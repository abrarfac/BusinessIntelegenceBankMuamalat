# BusinessIntelegenceBankMuamalat

I faced the challenge of important sales data being scattered across various separate sources (such as Customers, Orders, Products, and Product Categories). The lack of integration between these data made it difficult for management to obtain a comprehensive overview of business performance and sales trends.

My main task is to integrate these various pieces of data into a structured and easily analyzable system. Through the process of processing previously unconnected data, I strive to produce accurate, comprehensive, and easy-to-understand information to support the company's strategic decision-making.

This project focuses on building a systematic and organized data model by creating a data integration pipeline as a single source of truth. Additionally, the project includes the development of an informative and user-friendly Business Intelligence dashboard. The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven visualizations and recommendations to help management identify opportunities and determine the right strategic steps.
